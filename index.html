      <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>Tags for identifying the <a>natural language</a> of content or the <a>international preferences</a> of users (in order to select the natural language of content) are one of the fundamental building blocks of the Web. The language tags found in Web and Internet formats and protocols are defined by [[BCP47]]. Consistent use of language tags provides applications the ability to perform language-specific formatting or processing. For example, a user-agent might use the language to select an appropriate font for displaying text or a Web page designer might style text differently in one language than in another.</p>
        
        <p>In addition, language tags are also used to identify <a>international preferences</a> linked to culture, region, or language. Because these preferences are linked to the natural language or regional association of the end user, [[BCP47]] provides a natural way of encoding these preferences also. Such preferences are applied to processes such as presenting numbers, dates, or times; sorting lists linguistically; providing defaults for items such as the presentation of a calendar, common units of measurement, or 12- vs. 24-hour time presentation; and many other details that users might find too tedious to set individually. Collectively, these preferences are usually called a <a>locale</a>.</p>
        
        <p>This document describes best practices for the adoption and use of [[BCP47]] language tags for the identification of <a>natural language</a> content as well as the use of language tags to represent the locale preferences of the user or content author. It describes how document formats, specifications, and implementations should handle the language tags described by [[BCP47]], as well as data structures that extend these tags to describe <a>international preferences</a> (see also sec. 3.1 in [[WS-I18N-SCENARIOS]]). </p>
        
        <p>Identification of language and locale has a broad range of applications within the World Wide Web. Existing standards which make use of language identification include the <code>xml:lang</code> attribute in [[XML10]], the <code>lang</code> and <code>hreflang</code> atttributes in [[HTML]], the <code>language</code> property in [[XSL10]], and the <code>:lang</code> pseudo-class in CSS [[CSS3-SELECTORS]]. Language tags are also used to identify locales, such as in the Unicode Common Locale Data Repository or "CLDR" project [[CLDR]].</p>
        
        <p>Historically, locales were identified by the programming language or operating environment of the user. This application-specific identifier was often inferred from language tags. For example, an implementation could map a language tag from an existing protocol, such as HTTP's Accept-Language header, to its locale model. Locales may also be identified directly by using the language tag syntax in data items (elements, attributes, headers, etc.) that explicitly serve the purpose of locale identification.</p>
        
        <p>Unicode Locales are an extension of [[BCP47]] defined as part of Unicode's [[CLDR]] project. These identifiers are identical to language tags, but apply additional rules about the content of certain language tags. Unicode Locales increasingly form the basis for <a>internationalization</a> on the Web, particularly as part of the <code>Intl</code> locale framework in JavaScript.</p>

      <section id="out_of_scope">
        <h3>Out of Scope</h3>
        <p>This specification does not deal with formats for locale data or
          actual locale data. One source of locale data and data formats is the
          Unicode Common Locale Data Repository project ([[CLDR]]).</p>

      <section id="i18n-terminology">
        <h3>What are Internationalization and Localization?</h3>
        <p>Users who speak different languages or come from different cultural
          backgrounds usually require software and services that are adapted to
          correctly process information using their native languages, writing
          systems, measurement systems, calendars, and other linguistic rules
          and cultural conventions.</p>
        <p><dfn id="international-preferences">International Preferences</dfn> A
          user's particular set of cultural conventions, language, and
          formatting choices that software must employ to correctly process or
          present information exchanged with that user.</p>
        <p><dfn id="internationalization">Internationalization</dfn> The design
          and development of a product that is enabled for target audiences that
          vary in culture, region, or language. <em>Internationalization</em>
          is sometimes abbreviated <dfn title="I18N"><code>I18N</code></dfn>
          because there are eighteen letters between the "i" and the "n" in the
          English word.</p>
        <p>There are many kinds of international preferences that may be offered
          on the Web in order for the content or service to be considered usable
          and acceptable by users around the world. Some of these preferences
          might include: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Natural language for text processing: parsing, spell checking, and
            grammar checking are examples of this</li>
          <li>User interface language, which may include items like images,
            colors, sounds, formats, and navigational elements as well as the
            visible strings</li>
          <li>Presentation (human-oriented formatting) of dates, times, numbers,
            lists, and other values</li>
          <li>Collation, sorting, and organization of content (such as in a
            phone book or a dictionary)</li>
          <li>Alternate time-keeping and calendars, which may include holidays,
            work rules, weekday/weekend distinctions, the number and
            organization of months, the numbering of years, and so forth</li>
          <li>Tax or regulatory regime</li>
          <li>Currency</li>
        </ul>
        ... and many more.
        <p>Because there are a large number of preferences, software systems
          (operating environments and programming languages) often use an
          identifier that combines natural language and other information, such
          as region or country, as a shorthand indicator for collections of
          preferences that typify categories of users that share certain
          cultural preferences.</p>
        <p>HTML for example uses the <code>lang</code> attribute to indicate
          the language of segments of content. XML uses the <code>xml:lang</code>
          attribute for the same purpose.</p>
        <p>Java, POSIX, .NET and other software development technologies use a
          similar-looking (but not identical) construct known as a locale to
          activate certain internationalized capabilities in software.</p>
        <p><dfn id="locale">Locale</dfn> A collection of international
          preferences, generally related to a language and geographic region
          that a (certain category) of users require. These are usually
          identified by a shorthand identifier or token, such as a language tag,
          that is passed from the environment to various processes to get
          culturally affected behavior.</p>
        <p>Generally, systems that are internationalized can support a wide
          variety of languages and behaviors to meet the international
          preferences of many kinds of users. When a particular system can
          respond to changes in the locale by trying to load different resources
          or performing culturally appropriate formatting we say that this
          system is <em>locale-aware</em> or <em>enabled</em>.&nbsp; </p>
        <p><dfn id="localization">Localization</dfn> The tailoring of a system
          to the individual cultural expectations of a specific target market or
          group of individuals. Localization includes, but is not limited to,
          the translation of user-facing text and messages. Localization is
          sometimes abbreviated as <dfn title="L10N">L10N</dfn> because there
          are ten letters between the "L" and the "N" in the English word.</p>
        <p>When a particular set of content and preferences corresponding to a
          specific locale is operationally available, then the system is said to
          be <em>localized</em>. </p>
        <p>Localized systems often need to perform matching between the
          end-user's international preferences (their "locale") and the
          resources, content, or processing available. This is called <dfn id="language_negotiation">Language
            Negotiation</dfn>. Language negotiation is, thus, process of
          matching a user's preferences (in the form of a locale or language
          tag) to available localized resources. The system searches for
          matching content or logic "falling-back" from more-specific resources
          to more-general ones following a deterministic pattern.</p>
        <p>Language tags can provide information about the language, script,
          region, and language variation using subtags. But sometimes there are
          international preferences that do not correlate directly with any of
          these. For example, many cultures have more than one way of sorting
          content items, and so the appropriate sort ordering cannot always be
          inferred from the language tag by itself. So, for example, German
          language users might want to choose between the sort orderings used in
          a dictionary versus in a phone book.</p>
        <p>One way to indicate these preferences is via registered Extensions to
          [[BCP47]]. The Unicode Common Locale Data Repository project
          [[CLDR]] maintains two such extensions: [[RFC6497]] defines an
          extension that describes <em>transformations</em> (generally text
          transformations, such as transliteration between scripts).
          [[RFC6067]] defines <dfn id="unicode_locales">Unicode locales</dfn>,
          which provide the ability to specify in a language tag a number of the
          international preference variations that users or content authors
          might wish to specify directly (such as the German dictionary/phone
          book difference described above).</p>
        <p class="note">Some preferences are individual and are left to content
          authors, service providers, operating environments, or user agents to
          define and manage on behalf of the user.</p>

        <h3>Languages, Language Tags and Matching of Language Tags</h3>
        
        <p>This document uses the term <dfn title="language">language</dfn> to
          refer to what is sometimes called a <em><dfn>natural language</dfn></em>: the
          spoken, written, or signed communications used by human beings.</p>
        <p>There are many ways that languages might be identified and many
          reasons that software might need to identify the language of content
          on the Web. Document formats and protocols on the Web generally use
          the identifiers used in most other parts of the Internet, consisting
          of the language tags defined in [[BCP47]].</p>
        <p>[[BCP47]] is a multipart document consisting, at the time this
          document was published, of two separate RFCs. The first part, called <em>Tags
            for Identifying Languages</em> [[RFC5646]], defines the grammar,
          form, and terminology of language tags. The second part, called <em>Matching
            of Language Tags</em> [[RFC4647]], describes several schemes for
          matching, comparing, and selecting content using language tags and
          includes useful terminology related to comparison of language
          preferences to tagged content.</p>
        <p>A <dfn title="language-tag">language tag</dfn> is a string used as
          an identifier for a language. In this document, the term <em>language
            tag</em> always refers explicitly to a [[BCP47]] language tag.
          These language tags consist of one or more subtags.</p>
        <p>A <dfn data-lt="subtag|subtags">subtag</dfn> is a sequence of ASCII letters or
          digits separated from other subtags by the hyphen-minus character and
          identifying a specific element of meaning withing the overall language
          tag. In [[BCP47]], subtags can consist of upper or lowercase ASCII
          letters (the case carries no distinction) or ASCII digits. Subtags are
          limited to no more than eight characters (although additional length
          restrictions apply depending on the specific use of the subtag).</p>
        <p>Selecting content or behavior based on the language tag requires a
          few additional concepts defined by [[RFC4647]]. In this document, we
          adopt the following terminology:</p>
          
        <p>[[BCP47]] defines different levels of conformance. See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47#section-2.2.9">classes of conformance</a> in [[BCP47]] for specifics. For language tags, the levels of conformance correspond to type of validation that an implementation applies to language tag values.</p>
        
        <p>A <dfn data-lt="well-formed|well-formed language tag">well-formed langauge tag</dfn> follows the grammar defined in [[BCP47]]. That is, it is structurally correct, consisting of ASCII letters and digit <a>subtags</a> of the prescribed length, separated by hyphens.</p>
        <p>A <dfn data-lt="valid|valid language tag">valid language tag</dfn> has been checked to ensure that each of the subtags appears in the <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry">Language Subtag Registry</a> hosted by IANA.</p>
          
        <p>A <dfn title="language-range">language range</dfn> is a string
          similar in structure to a language tag that is used for "identifying
          sets of language tags that share specific attributes".</p>
        <p>A <dfn title="language-priority-list">language priority list</dfn>
          is a collection of one or more language ranges identifying the user's
          language preferences for use in matching. As the name suggests, such
          lists are normally ordered or weighted according to the user's
          preferences. The HTTP [[RFC2616]] <code>Accept-Language</code>[[RFC3282]]
          header is an example of one kind of language priority list.</p>
        <p>A <dfn title="basic-language-range">basic language range</dfn> is
          simply a language tag used to express a language preference. An <dfn

            title="extended-language-range">extended language range</dfn> allows
          a more expressive set of language preference through the use of a
          wildcard subtag <q><code>*</code></q>.</p>
        <aside class="example">
          <p>Basic versus extended language range and language priority list</p>
          <p>The string <code>de-de</code> is a basic language range. It
            matches, for example, the language tag <code>de-DE-1996</code>, but
            not the language tag <code>de-Deva</code>.</p>
          <p>The string <code>de-*-DE</code> is an extended language range. It
            matches all of the following tags:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><code>de-DE</code></p>

              <p><code>de-Latn-DE-1996</code></p>

          </ul>
          <p><code>"en; fr; zh-Hant"</code> is a language priority list. It
            would be read as "<span class="quote">English before French before
              Chinese as written in the Traditional script</span>". Note that
            the syntax shown is only an example, since it depends on the
            protocol, application, or implementation that uses the list.</p>

	    <h3>How to Define Language Tags and How to Reference Language Tag Standards</h3>
        <p class="advisement">Specifications for the Web that require language identification MUST refer to [[BCP47]]. </p>
        
        <p class="advisement">Specifications SHOULD NOT refer to specific component RFCs.</p>
        <p>The "BCP" nomenclature refers to the current set of RFCs that form the "best current practice". At the time this document was published, [[BCP47]] consisted of two RFCs: <cite>Tags for the Identification of Languages </cite>[[RFC5646]] and <cite>Matching of Language Tags</cite>[[RFC4647]].</p>
        
        <p class="advisement">Formulations such as "<span class="quote">RFC 5646 or its successor</span>" MAY be used, but only in cases where the specific document version is necessary.</p>
        <p>While this style of reference was once popular, using the
          BCP reference is more accurate. Since the grammar of language tags has
          been fixed since [[RFC4646]], referring to the BCP will not incur
          additional compliance risk to most implementations.</p>
          
        <p class="advisement">Specifications MUST NOT reference obsolete versions of [[BCP47]], such as [[RFC1766]] or [[RFC3066]].</p>
        <p class="advisement">Specifications that need to preserve compatibility with obsolete versions of [[BCP47]] MUST reference the production <code>obs-language-tag</code> in [[BCP47]].</p>
        <p>Beginning with [[RFC4646]], [[BCP47]] defined a more complex, machine-readable syntax for language tags. Some specifications might desire or require compatibility with the older language tag grammar found in previous versions of BCP47 (specifically [[RFC1766]] and [[RFC3066]]). This grammar was more permissive and is described in [[BCP47]] as the ABNF production <code>obs-language-tag</code>. [[RFC4646]], which introduced the current grammar for language tags, is itself obsolete.</p>
        
        <p class="advisement">Specifications MAY reference registered extensions to [[BCP47]] as necessary.</p>
        <p>In particular, [[RFC6067]] defines the <cite>BCP 47 Extension U</cite>, also known as "Unicode Locales". This extension to [[BCP47]] provides additional subtag sequences for selecting specific locale variations.</p>
        
        <p class="advisement">Specifications SHOULD require that language tags be <a>well-formed</a>.</p>
        <p class="advisement">Specifications MAY require that language tags be <a>valid</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Checking if a tag is <a>valid</a> requires access to or a copy of the registry plus additional runtime logic. While content authors are advised to choose, generate, and exchange only valid values, language tag matching and other common language tag operations are designed so that validity checking is not needed. Features or functions that need to understand the specific semantic content of subtags are the main reason that a specification would normatively require <a>valid</a> tags as part of the protocol or document format.</p>
        
        <p class="advisement">Specifications SHOULD require content authors use <a>valid</a> language tags.</p>
        <p class="advisement">Content validators SHOULD check if content uses <a>valid</a> language tags where feasible.</p>

      <h3>Locale versus Natural Language</h3>
      <p>This document defines locale identifiers for use in Web technologies.
        Historically, language tags [[BCP47]] have been used as locale
        identifiers by many programming languages or operating environments,
        which is natural since locale identifiers usually share certain core
        features related to natural language and country/region. This
        specification defines locale identifiers that specific implementations
        can map to their features to Web standards in order to create
        functional, interoperable applications.</p>
      <p>The minimal requirement is the ability to specify the natural language;
        thus there is industry convergence on the use of [[BCP47]] as the core
        of a locale identifier. For example, [[CLDR]] uses [[BCP47]] as the
        core of a locale identifier, and provides syntax for extensions for
        non-linguistic information, such as preferred currency. This extension
        [[RFC6067]] is defined as a formal extension of [[BCP47]], making
        Unicode locale identifiers synonymous with language tags in most
        contexts.</p>
      <p>A major difference between language tags and locale identifiers is the
        meaning of the region code. In both language tags and locales, the
        region code indicates variation in language (as with regional dialects)
        or presentation and format (such as number or date formats). In a
        locale, the region code is also sometimes used to indicate the physical
        location, market, legal, or other governing policies for the user. </p>
      <p>The language tag may be available in several places. In HTTP, there is
        an Accept-Language header field which can be used. MIME has a
        Content-Language header which contains a language tag. In XML, there is
        an attribute which can be defined for elements called <code>xml:lang</code>.
        <code>xml:lang</code> marks all the contents and attribute values of the
        corresponding element as belonging to the language identified. What that
        means for processing those contents varies from application to
        application. </p>
      <p>For more detailed information on the behavior of <code>xml:lang</code>,
        see XML 1.0 (Fifth Edition)[[XML10]].</p>

      <h2>Language Tags and Locale Values</h2>

      <p>The following requirements are formulated for specifications which deal
        with language tags and locale values or matching schemes.</p>
      <ol class="depth1">
        <li>
          <p>Specifications that make use of language tags or locale values MUST
            meet the conformance criteria defined for "well-formed" processors,
            as defined in sec. 2.2.9 of [[RFC5646]].</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Specifications that make use of language tags or locale values MAY
            validate these values. If they do so, they MUST meet the conformance
            criteria defined for "validating" processors, as defined in sec.
            2.2.9 of [[RFC5646]].</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Specifications that define operations on language tags or locale
            values using matching MUST use either a basic language range or an
            extended language range.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Specifications that define operations on language tags or locale
            values using matching MUST specify whether the resulting language
            priority list contains a single result (<em>lookup</em> as defined
            in [[RFC4647]]), or a possible empty set of results (<em>filtering</em>
            as defined in [[RFC4647]]).</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <div class="note">
        <p>Note: Many specifications created before [[RFC5646]] and
          [[RFC4647]] are conformant to these criteria. The purpose of the
          criteria is to provide a stable source for requirements for language
          and locale identification.</p>

        <h3>Choice of Language Tag</h3>
        <p class="note">General guidelines for the choice of language tags are
          described by articles maintained by the Internationalization Working
          Group.</p>
        <p>When choosing a language tag or locale identifier, use the shortest
          tag that conveys useful meaning. For example, the phrase <q lang="de">Guten
            Tag, Welt!</q> could use either of the tags <code>de</code> or the
          tag <code>de-DE-1996-u-cu-EUR-nu-latn</code>. While either tag is
          valid and identifies the text, the later tag is overly specific.</p>

          <h4>Use of Script subtags</h4>

            script. For these languages, the use of the script subtag is
            RECOMMENDED. Some languages that are known to vary in script

      <h3>Application Scenario: Web Services Internationalization</h3>
      <p class="issue">This section was part of the original LTLI document and exists to address items identified in [[WS-I18N-REQ]]. It refers to this document as a "specification" (which it no longer is). Removing this section is probably the next step.</p>
      
      <p>In order to enable multi-locale operation of Web services and to create the ability for locale negotiation, this specification describes a standardized method for identifying locales and locale and/or language tags on the Web, including non-normative guidelines for implementation. This is called out in Requirement <code>R005</code> of <cite>Requirements for the Internationalization of Web Services</cite> [[WS-I18N-REQ]]. The mechanism for language and locale identification which is defined in this specification will be used in a future version of the description of Web services Internationalization in <cite>Web Services Internationalization (WS-I18N)</cite>[[WS-I18N]].</p>
      <p>Further application scenarios of this specification encompass, for example, the standards mentioned in the <a href="#introduction">Introduction</a>. Scenarios can be divided in four areas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Definition of values for language tags</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Definition of values for locale identifiers</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Definition of matching schemes for language tags</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Definition of matching schemes for locale identifiers</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>As for matching of language tags, many specifications already define
        operations using matching. An example is the language pseudo-class <code>:lang</code>
        defined in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-CSS21-20050613/selector.html#lang">sec.
          5.11.4</a> of [[CSS21]]. It matches elements based on their language.
        This specification formulates requirements on such operations, based on
        [[RFC4647]].</p>
